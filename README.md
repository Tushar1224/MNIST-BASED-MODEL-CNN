# MNIST-BASED-MODEL-Convolutional-Neural-Network
It is a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)  model trained on MNIST Dataset(Handwritten Digits dataset) with an accuracy of 99.6. 
It uses tensorflow, keras for model preparation and for the calculation purposes uses numpy and pandas and pyplot of matplotlib for plotting the plots.
Also the Visualisation each layer of the sequential model is done too.
